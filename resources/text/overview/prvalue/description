prvalues are rvalues which are "pure," meaning they've never been bound to a name. They're often just called temporaries and are the result of any function which returns a non-reference value type, as well as most literals. prvalues can have their lifetime prolonged by binding to another reference type. The lifetime of a prvalue is the extent of the full expression.
