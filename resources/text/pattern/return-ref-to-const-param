An lvalue reference-to-const parameter may be bound to an outside lvalue, or it may be prolonging the lifetime of a prvalue. The lifetime of the prvalue to which the parameter is potentially bound is within the scope of the full expression. That means that it's not well-defined to return an lvalue reference-to-const and bind it to an lvalue reference-to-const (the same applies when binding to an rvalue reference): the original prvalue's lifetime cannot be extended further. In this case, return a non-reference type.
