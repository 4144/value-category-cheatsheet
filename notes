TODO:
  - Add a section on forwarding references
  - Add more patterns
  - Invalid code, such as prvalue -> non-const lvalue binding
  - Remove idiomatic tag?

Patterns:
  --
  Return a struct and try to keep a ref to a member
  Return a container and try to keep a ref to an element
  Bind an rvalue string to a string_view
  Return lvalue member from rvalue member function
