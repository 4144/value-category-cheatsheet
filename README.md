# C++ value category cheatsheet

Herein lies a generated PDF which outlines the common pitfalls and edge cases
with C++'s lvalues, rvalues, and the like. The cheatsheet is generated by
running an HTTP server using [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and
[Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) and then converting the produced
web page to a PDF using [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).

This project accompanied a talk I presented, in hopes of conveying the
intricacies of everyday C++ work.

## Running locally
